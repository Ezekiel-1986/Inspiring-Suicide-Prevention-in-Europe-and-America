Suicide is a societal problem that affects people of different age groups and societal strata. The dataset will help to analyse the relationships between different demographic variables and suicide with the aim of inspiring more societal programs to prevent suicide.
This compiled dataset was pulled from four other datasets (United Nations Development 
Program, World Bank and World Health Organization) linked by time and place, and was 
built to find signals correlated to increased suicide rates among different cohorts globally, 
across the socio-economic spectrum.
